With **blogdown**, you can include figures that result from R code like plots, as well as images from other sources in posts. For the former, you will need to be working from an R Markdown post, but for the latter, you can be working in either a markdown or R Markdown post. To read more about the differences between the two posting formats, read [this chapter](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/output-format.html) in the **blogdown** book.

# Example 1: Including figures from R code

In an R Markdown post, you can insert an R code chunk that produces a figure like this:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
oplot <- ggplot(Orange, aes(x = age, 
                   y = circumference, 
                   colour = Tree)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  guides(colour = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
oplot
```

You can use the **knitr** chunk options to control aspects of how the figure is displayed. Read more about these options in the [**bookdown** book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/figures.html).

You may also use the chunk options to automatically produce numbered figures with captions. To do this, you will need to do two things:

1. Label the R code chunk used to produce the figure 
2. Use the `fig.cap =` chunk option to provide a figure caption. 

Note that the chunk label should not have underscores; it should only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), slashes (/), or dashes (-). 

To reference the figure in the text of your post, use the syntax `\@ref(fig:chunk-label)`,^[Do not forget the leading backslash! And also note the parentheses `()` after `ref`; they are not curly braces `{}`.] where `chunk-label` is the label of the chunk containing the R code that produces the figure.


````markdown
`r ''````{r orange-tree-fig, fig.cap = "Growth of orange trees"}
oplot
```
````


```{r orange-tree-fig, fig.cap = "Growth of orange trees", echo = FALSE}
oplot
```

Now, a reference in the text of the post to `\@ref(fig:orange-tree-fig)` will produce a link to Figure \@ref(fig:orange-tree-fig).

# Example 2: Including other images

You have a few options for adding other types of images to posts. First, you can use markdown syntax, as in: 

````markdown
![](/path/to/my/image.png)
````

In a **blogdown** site, this image file is assumed to be located in the `/static/` directory. So if you save your image file in a subdirectory called `/static/img/`, the file path would be ```(/img/image.png)```.

If you are working in an R Markdown post, you may also include images via the function `knitr::include_graphics()` within an R code chunk. Again, **blogdown** assumes that the image file is in your `/static/` directory, so the file path you provide should be relative to that directory. In the example below, the knit-logo.png file is located in the `/static/img/` directory.


```{r knitr-logo, out.width='32.8%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Three knitr logos included in the document from an external PNG image file.'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep('/img/knit-logo.png', 3))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:knitr-logo) is an example of three **knitr** logos included in a figure environment. You can read more about the advantages of using the `knitr::include_graphics()` function [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/figures.html).
